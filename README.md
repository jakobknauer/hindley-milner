An implementation of [Algorithm J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system#Algorithm_J) for type inference in the [Hindley-Milner type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system),
written in Rust.
The notation (identifiers etc.) as well as the algorithm itself closely follow the description on Wikipedia.

Furthermore, a parser for expressions is included.
